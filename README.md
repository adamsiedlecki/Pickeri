# Pickeri
Project designed for collecting and processing data about fruit pickers. I have designed this for owners of soft fruits plantations, who employ lots of people in a short period of time and often use only paper notebook. Time is money and Pickeri is for saving both. 

This applications is missing a good android mobile app. I hope to have a time for that in the future.
